# XP Core Values Implemented
- Comminication: We maintained a hybrid meeting schedule, gathering in person twice a week and convening online once to ensure effective coordination. These meetings were dedicated to discussing the tasks and progress of each team member.
- Feedback: Our meetings included a comprehensive review of both completed and ongoing work, followed by constructive feedback for improvement and to promote collaboration and progress,. At the end of every two-week cycle, we conducted Sprint sessions to assess pending and completed tasks, as well as areas that required improvement.

# Scrum Meetings
- We used two week sprints with hybrid scrum meeting schedule:
   - Tuesday: 3:00am - 6:00pm
   - Thursday: 3:00am -6:00pm
   - Saturday: 10:00am - 12:00pm

# Design Decisions
- Frontend : React : We chose React as our frontend framework due to its modularity, efficiency, and ease of use.
React's virtual DOM enables fast rendering and a smooth user experience.
- Backend: Spring Boot: We chose Spring Boot as our backend framework due to its robustness, scalability, and compatibility with Java.
Spring Boot's modular architecture and dependency management simplify project setup and integration with other libraries and frameworks. We also considered the fact that Spring Boot works well with React for frontend development.
- Database: MongoDB : We evaluated several database options, including MySQL and PostgreSQL. Ultimately, we decided to use MongoDB due to its scalability, flexibility, and compatibility with Spring Boot. pring Boot offers built-in support for MongoDB through the Spring Data MongoDB library. This integration enables us to leverage MongoDB's advanced querying and indexing features to build a powerful and efficient database layer for our web application.
